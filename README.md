# 🕵️‍♂️ ShadowReq – Anonymous Requests with Server Rotation

**ShadowReq** is a Python library that allows you to send HTTP requests using random servers, ensuring greater anonymity and avoiding IP blocks. With support for dynamic proxies and automatic rotation, ShadowReq is perfect for web scraping, test automation, and distributed access to APIs.

## 🚀 Key Features:
- ✔ **Automatic Server Rotation** – Randomly selects a server for each request.
- ✔ **Load Balancing** – Distributes requests to avoid overloading a single server.
- ✔ **Flexible Configuration** – Customize timeouts, headers, and more.
- ✔ **Easy Integration** – Simple API, compatible with `requests` and `httpx`.


📦 **Installation:**  
```bash
pip install shadowreq
```
